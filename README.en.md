## Description

The `Stopwatch CLI` is a simple and functional stopwatch application that runs directly in the terminal. Developed in
Python, it allows you to monitor the time spent on activities in a practical and efficient way. This project takes
inspiration from a challenge in
the [app-ideas repository](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Stopwatch-App.md).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sigaocaue/stopwatch-challenge
   cd stopwatch-cli

2. Run the script:

    - Run the script directly with Python:
      ```bash
         python src/stopwatch/stopwatch.py
      ```
   - Install the CLI and run it using the stopwatch command:
      ```bash
         pip install .
         stopwatch
      ```

## Usage

- **`stopwatch start`:** Start the stopwatch
- **`stopwatch stop`:** Pause the stopwatch
